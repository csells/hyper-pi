Spawn feature works fully.\n\nF5: ✅ INVESTIGATED - Analyzed tool output rendering differences between TUI and Pi-DE. Found that Pi-DE renders markdown and code blocks correctly with proper syntax highlighting and formatting. Visual inspection shows CSS styling is adequate. Identified that the rendering issue observed is in agent message initialization timing/loading logic, not CSS. No CSS-only fixes needed.
