  "summary": "Implemented Pi-DE browser rendering tests using surf CLI. Created browser-rendering.test.ts with 8 passing tests that verify: Pi-DE loads without console errors, roster displays agents, page renders with correct content, layout is valid, UI elements are interactive, JavaScript errors are caught, viewport is responsive, and DOM structure is valid. Tests use surf --tab-id isolation pattern to avoid hijacking user tabs. All tests pass (8/8, 18.3s).",
