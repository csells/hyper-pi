  "summary": "Created cross-channel.test.ts with 6 tests: Web → TUI visibility, TUI → Web visibility, TUI response → Web events, Concurrent clients (TUI+Web), Follow-up from web while TUI streams, Concurrent web clients see each other's messages. Fixed the last test that had Promise.race issues with BufferedWs by using simpler sequential web client connections. All 6 pass (57s total)."
