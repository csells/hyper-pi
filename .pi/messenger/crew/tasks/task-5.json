  "summary": "Created message-roundtrip.test.ts with 4 tests using real pi agents: receives init_state on proxy connect, send text → agent processes and streams response back (verifies message_start/message_update/message_end events), init_state contains history after a conversation turn, multiple proxy clients both receive events. All pass (12s total). Built connectProxy() helper with event-driven waitFor() pattern that avoids BufferedWs race conditions."
