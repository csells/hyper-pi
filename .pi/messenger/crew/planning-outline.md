**Parallelism summary:** The 8 tasks form 3 independent work streams that can execute concurrently:

- **Stream A (Pi-DE frontend):** Task 1 + Task 2 + Task 4 → Task 3 → (done)
- **Stream B (Hypivisor Rust):** Task 5 + Task 6 → Task 8
- **Stream C (pi-socket TypeScript):** Task 7

Wave 1 (all independent): Tasks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
Wave 2 (after deps): Task 3 (needs Task 2), Task 8 (needs Tasks 5+6)

Critical path length: **2 waves** — nearly all work happens in wave 1.
