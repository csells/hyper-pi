Join the mesh\n2. Read task spec to understand requirements\n3. Start task and reserve files\n4. Implement the feature\n5. Commit your changes\n6. Release reservations and mark complete\n\n## Concurrent Tasks\n\nThese tasks are being worked on by other workers in this wave. Discover their agent names after joining the mesh via `pi_messenger({ action: \"list\" })`.\n\n- task-1: Fix ghost nodes in useHypivisor.ts\n- task-2: Fix useAgent.ts connection leaks and error handling\n- task-3: Fix RemoteAgent event listener leak\n- task-4: Fix rpc.ts pending requests leak and SpawnModal loop\n- task-5: Fix hypivisor broadcast thread hang and FD leaks\n- task-6: Fix hypivisor proxy: validate handshake, use node.machine, URL-decode token\n- task-7: Fix pi-socket: truncation perf, async boundary, logger\n- task-9: Add integration tests for reconnect and multi-agent scenarios\n\n## Task Specification\n\n# Fix hypivisor NodeStatus enum and deregister auth\n\n## Problem\n1. `NodeInfo.status` is `String` — typos compile silently, no exhaustive matching\n2. `deregister` RPC has no authorization — any client can remove any node\n\n## Files\n- `hypivisor/src/state.rs`\n- `hypivisor/src/rpc.rs`\n- `hypivisor/src/cleanup.rs`\n- `hypivisor/src/main.rs` (status comparisons)\n\n## Changes\n1. Replace `pub status: String` with `pub enum NodeStatus { Active, Offline }` with `#[serde(rename_all = \"lowercase\")]`\n2. Update all code that compares `node.status == \"active\"` / `\"offline\"` to use the enum\n3. Pass `registered_node_id` into dispatch context. In `handle_deregister`, verify the caller's registered node ID matches the deregister target, OR allow deregister if no registered_node_id (for dashboard admin use)\n\n## Tests\n- Existing tests should compile and pass with the new enum\n- Add test: deregister fails when caller doesn't own the node\n- Add test: deregister succeeds when caller owns the node\n\n\n## Plan Context\n\n---\n\n**Parallelism summary:** The 8 tasks form 3 independent work streams that can execute concurrently:\n\n- **Stream A (Pi-DE frontend):** Task 1 + Task 2 + Task 4 → Task 3 → (done)\n- **Stream B (Hypivisor Rust):** Task 5 + Task 6 → Task 8\n- **Stream C (pi-socket TypeScript):** Task 7\n\nWave 1 (all independent): Tasks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\nWave 2 (after deps): Task 3 (needs Task 2), Task 8 (needs Tasks 5+6)\n\nCritical path length: **2 waves** — nearly all work happens in wave 1.\n## Coordination\n\n**Message budget: 10 messages this session.** The system enforces this — sends are rejected after the limit.\n\n**Broadcasts go to the team feed — only the user sees them live.** Other workers see your broadcasts in their initial context only. Use DMs for time-sensitive peer coordination.\n\n### Announce yourself\nAfter joining the mesh and starting your task, announce what you're working on:\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"broadcast\", message: \"Starting <task-id> (<title>) — will create <files>\" })\n```\n\n### Coordinate with peers\nIf a concurrent task involves files or interfaces related to yours, send a brief DM. Only message when there's a concrete coordination need — shared files, interfaces, or blocking questions.\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"send\", to: \"<peer-name>\", message: \"I'm exporting FormatOptions from types.ts — will you need it?\" })\n```\n\n### Responding to messages\nIf a peer asks you a direct question, reply briefly. Ignore messages that don't require a response. Do NOT start casual conversations.\n\n### On completion\nAnnounce what you built:\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"broadcast\", message: \"Completed <task-id>: <file> exports <symbols>\" })\n```\n\n### Reservations\nBefore editing files, check if another worker has reserved them via `pi_messenger({ action: \"list\" })`. If a file you need is reserved, message the owner to coordinate. Do NOT edit reserved files without coordinating first.\n\n### Questions about dependencies\nIf your task depends on a completed task and something about its implementation is unclear, read the code and the task's progress log at `.pi/messenger/crew/tasks/<task-id>.progress.md`. Dependency authors are from previous waves and are no longer in the mesh.\n\n### Claim next task\nAfter completing your assigned task, check if there are ready tasks you can pick up:\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"task.ready\" })\n```\n\nIf a task is ready, claim and implement it. If `task.start` fails (another worker claimed it first), check for other ready tasks. Only claim if your current task completed cleanly and quickly.\n\n"}],"timestamp":1771855991920}}

Join the mesh\n2. Read task spec to understand requirements\n3. Start task and reserve files\n4. Implement the feature\n5. Commit your changes\n6. Release reservations and mark complete\n\n## Concurrent Tasks\n\nThese tasks are being worked on by other workers in this wave. Discover their agent names after joining the mesh via `pi_messenger({ action: \"list\" })`.\n\n- task-1: Fix ghost nodes in useHypivisor.ts\n- task-2: Fix useAgent.ts connection leaks and error handling\n- task-3: Fix RemoteAgent event listener leak\n- task-4: Fix rpc.ts pending requests leak and SpawnModal loop\n- task-5: Fix hypivisor broadcast thread hang and FD leaks\n- task-6: Fix hypivisor proxy: validate handshake, use node.machine, URL-decode token\n- task-7: Fix pi-socket: truncation perf, async boundary, logger\n- task-9: Add integration tests for reconnect and multi-agent scenarios\n\n## Task Specification\n\n# Fix hypivisor NodeStatus enum and deregister auth\n\n## Problem\n1. `NodeInfo.status` is `String` — typos compile silently, no exhaustive matching\n2. `deregister` RPC has no authorization — any client can remove any node\n\n## Files\n- `hypivisor/src/state.rs`\n- `hypivisor/src/rpc.rs`\n- `hypivisor/src/cleanup.rs`\n- `hypivisor/src/main.rs` (status comparisons)\n\n## Changes\n1. Replace `pub status: String` with `pub enum NodeStatus { Active, Offline }` with `#[serde(rename_all = \"lowercase\")]`\n2. Update all code that compares `node.status == \"active\"` / `\"offline\"` to use the enum\n3. Pass `registered_node_id` into dispatch context. In `handle_deregister`, verify the caller's registered node ID matches the deregister target, OR allow deregister if no registered_node_id (for dashboard admin use)\n\n## Tests\n- Existing tests should compile and pass with the new enum\n- Add test: deregister fails when caller doesn't own the node\n- Add test: deregister succeeds when caller owns the node\n\n\n## Plan Context\n\n---\n\n**Parallelism summary:** The 8 tasks form 3 independent work streams that can execute concurrently:\n\n- **Stream A (Pi-DE frontend):** Task 1 + Task 2 + Task 4 → Task 3 → (done)\n- **Stream B (Hypivisor Rust):** Task 5 + Task 6 → Task 8\n- **Stream C (pi-socket TypeScript):** Task 7\n\nWave 1 (all independent): Tasks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\nWave 2 (after deps): Task 3 (needs Task 2), Task 8 (needs Tasks 5+6)\n\nCritical path length: **2 waves** — nearly all work happens in wave 1.\n## Coordination\n\n**Message budget: 10 messages this session.** The system enforces this — sends are rejected after the limit.\n\n**Broadcasts go to the team feed — only the user sees them live.** Other workers see your broadcasts in their initial context only. Use DMs for time-sensitive peer coordination.\n\n### Announce yourself\nAfter joining the mesh and starting your task, announce what you're working on:\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"broadcast\", message: \"Starting <task-id> (<title>) — will create <files>\" })\n```\n\n### Coordinate with peers\nIf a concurrent task involves files or interfaces related to yours, send a brief DM. Only message when there's a concrete coordination need — shared files, interfaces, or blocking questions.\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"send\", to: \"<peer-name>\", message: \"I'm exporting FormatOptions from types.ts — will you need it?\" })\n```\n\n### Responding to messages\nIf a peer asks you a direct question, reply briefly. Ignore messages that don't require a response. Do NOT start casual conversations.\n\n### On completion\nAnnounce what you built:\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"broadcast\", message: \"Completed <task-id>: <file> exports <symbols>\" })\n```\n\n### Reservations\nBefore editing files, check if another worker has reserved them via `pi_messenger({ action: \"list\" })`. If a file you need is reserved, message the owner to coordinate. Do NOT edit reserved files without coordinating first.\n\n### Questions about dependencies\nIf your task depends on a completed task and something about its implementation is unclear, read the code and the task's progress log at `.pi/messenger/crew/tasks/<task-id>.progress.md`. Dependency authors are from previous waves and are no longer in the mesh.\n\n### Claim next task\nAfter completing your assigned task, check if there are ready tasks you can pick up:\n\n```typescript\npi_messenger({ action: \"task.ready\" })\n```\n\nIf a task is ready, claim and implement it. If `task.start` fails (another worker claimed it first), check for other ready tasks. Only claim if your current task completed cleanly and quickly.\n\n"}],"timestamp":1771855991920},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The user wants me to implement task-8, which is about:\n1.

Replace `pub status: String` with `pub enum NodeStatus { Active, Offline }` with `#[serde(rename_all = \"lowercase\")]`\n2. Update all code that compares `node.status == \"active\"` / `\"offline\"` to use the enum\n3. Pass `registered_node_id` into dispatch context. In `handle_deregister`, verify the caller's registered node ID matches the deregister target, OR allow deregister if no registered_node_id (for dashboard admin use)\n\n## Tests\n- Existing tests should compile and pass with the new enum\n- Add test: deregister fails when caller doesn't own the node\n- Add test: deregister succeeds when caller owns the node\n\n```\n\nWhen done: `pi_messenger({ action: \"task.done\", id: \"task-8\", summary: \"...\" })`\nIf blocked: `pi_messenger({ action: \"task.block\", id: \"task-8\", reason: \"...\" })`"}],"details":{"mode":"task.start","task":{"id":"task-8","title":"Fix hypivisor NodeStatus enum and deregister auth","status":"in_progress","assigned_to":"RedLion","attempt_count":1,"base_commit":"39f2f358294cb996aa0dffbb5bc6e22db819bc38"}},"isError":false,"timestamp":1771856003110},{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"toolu_011GdJC6osb8Xij95xnL7dBh","toolName":"pi_messenger","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Broadcast logged.
